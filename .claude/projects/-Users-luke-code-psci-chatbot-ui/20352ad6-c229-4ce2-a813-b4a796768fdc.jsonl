You understand the importance of providing sufficient context, specific requirements, and helpful resources to ensure efficient task\ncompletion.\n\nYour task is to draft a detailed Jira ticket based on the information provided by the user. The ticket should include the following sections:\n\n```md\nA brief, one-sentence description of the task.\n\nh3. Useful Links\n\nA bulleted list of any useful links\n\nh3. Why\n\nExplain the reasons behind this task. This should include the benefits of completing the task and any relevant context.\n\nh3. User Stories\n\n   Clearly define the expected user interactions and outcomes. Use the format:\n\n- As a [role], I want to [action], so that [outcome/benefit] (Include multiple user stories if applicable.)\n\nh3. Core Functionality\n\nWhat existing functionality needs to be maintained?\n\nh3. Implementation Details\n\nSpecific instructions or suggestions on how to implement the changes.\n\nh3. UI/UX Considerations\n\nHow should the changes affect the user interface and user experience?\n\nh3. Resources\n\nLinks to relevant documentation, code examples, or other resources. You should search the codebase for relevant files and ask the user\nif they know relevant files related to this issue.\n\nh3. Acceptance Criteria\n\nA list of specific, measurable criteria that must be met for the task to be considered complete.\n\nh3. Additional Notes\n\nAny relevant technical information, such as specific libraries to use, existing code to reference, or potential challenges. Any other information that\nmight be helpful to the developer. Helpful tips for the developer working on the task, such as where to start, what to focus on, or common pitfalls to\navoid.\n\n---\nIMPORTANT JIRA FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:\n\nWhen creating the Jira ticket, you MUST use Jira's native formatting syntax, NOT standard markdown:\n\n- Headings: Use h3. Heading Name instead of ### Heading Name\n- Bold text: Use *bold text* instead of **bold text**\n- Code/monospace: Use {{code}} instead of `code`\n- Code blocks: Use {code}language and {code} instead of ``` blocks\n- Lists: Standard bullet points work the same (- or *)\n- Links: Use [link text|URL] instead of [link text](URL)\n- Italic: Use _italic_ instead of *italic*\n\nFor acceptance criteria, use simple bullet points with - rather than trying to create checkboxes, as checkbox formatting in Jira is inconsistent.\n\nThe Jira ticket should be well-formatted, easy to read, and free of jargon. Use clear and concise language.\n\nYou should draft your response using standard markdown headings (###) for planning, but when creating the actual Jira ticket, convert all formatting to\nJira's native syntax.\n\nThe details of the JIRA ticket are:\n\n$ARGUMENTS\n\nAfter you write up the ticket summary you should use the atlassian MCP server to create an issue assigned to me in the DEV workspace.\n\n---\nConsider the following:\n\n1. Describe the feature clearly\n\n - What is the new functionality?\n - Where will it be implemented in the application?\n - Who will use it, and how does it fit into the overall product?\n2. Provide user stories\n\n - Who benefits from this feature?\n - What action should they be able to perform?\n - What is the desired outcome?\n3. Explain the requirements\n\n - Are there any dependencies on existing features?\n - Should this maintain backward compatibility?\n - Are there any UI/UX considerations (if applicable)?\n4. Mention any technical constraints\n\n - Are there specific technologies, frameworks, or libraries that must be used?\n - Are there performance, security, or scalability concerns?\n5. List any available resources\n - Do you have design mockups, API documentation, or reference materials?\n - Are there existing tickets or discussions related to this feature?\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"1fe44776-4695-43dd-bd58-56a11cd6d9c8","timestamp":"2025-08-22T15:37:08.301Z"}

So I want you to create an Epic and then create some subtasks based on the things I tell you right now. So right now our Salesforce integration just holds accounts and contacts, very minimal details, and it stores it as one massive Excel file, which is not very useful to our customers. What we want to do as an immediate fix to this is split up the integration data such that each account in Salesforce gets its own PDF file in our system. So under that account PDF file, we should have all the contacts. And then additionally, we need to expand upon what data we're actually pulling Salesforce. Right now it's pretty limited and we want to look into the Salesforce API to see if they have some sort of wild card functionality that lets us pull everything from an object. If we can do that, we want to just wild card and pull all the data for an account and contact and an opportunity from Salesforce into our system. So the two immediate big things here are one, splitting up the data from the large Excel sheet into a mass into a separate PDF files for each account. And then number two, expanding upon the data that is pulled for each account, including the opportunities, contacts and making sure that we pull as much data as possible for each account."},"uuid":"e9b1a20f-55ee-41c6-9e5e-12907aa23a09","timestamp":"2025-08-22T15:39:43.758Z"}

UI/UX Considerations\\n\\n- Customers will see organized folder structure with account-based PDFs instead of single Excel file\\n- PDF format should be well-structured with clear sections for Account details, Contacts, and Opportunities\\n- File naming should be intuitive (e.g., \\\"Account_Name_YYYY-MM-DD.pdf\\\")\\n\\nh3. Resources\\n\\n* Current implementation: {{integration-sync-worker/src/services/salesforce.service.ts}}\\n* Field constants: {{integration-sync-worker/src/utils/constants.ts}}\\n* [Salesforce API Documentation|https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/api-explorer/sobject]\\n* [JSForce Library Documentation|https://jsforce.github.io/]\\n\\nh3. Acceptance Criteria\\n\\n- Each Salesforce Account generates its own PDF file in storage\\n- PDF files contain all available Account fields (not limited to current 6 fields)\\n- Contact information is included within each Account's PDF\\n- Opportunity data is included where available\\n- File naming follows consistent convention\\n- Integration maintains backward compatibility with existing sync jobs\\n- Performance is maintained or improved compared to current Excel export\\n- All existing error handling and logging continues to work\\n\\nh3. Additional Notes\\n\\n*Current Implementation Analysis*:\\n- Uses {{SALESFORCE_OBJECT_SELECTED_FIELDS}} constant to limit field selection\\n- Exports to single Excel file via {{XLSX.utils.json_to_sheet}}\\n- Supports Account, Contact, Opportunity, and Note objects\\n- Uses SOQL queries with relationship-based sub-queries\\n\\n*Key Technical Considerations*:\\n- Investigate Salesforce API's {{describeGlobal()}} and field discovery capabilities for wildcard functionality\\n- Consider PDF generation library selection (PDF-lib, jsPDF, or Puppeteer)\\n- Plan for memory optimization when processing large datasets\\n- Ensure proper relationship mapping between Accounts, Contacts, and Opportunities\\n- Test with various Salesforce org configurations and permission levels\\n\\n*Development Approach*:\\n- Start with Salesforce API research to understand comprehensive field selection options\\n- Implement PDF generation for single account first\\n- Add contact and opportunity nesting\\n- Optimize for batch processing of multiple accounts\\n- Maintain integration path utility compatibility for storage organization\",\n    \"status\": {\n      \"name\": \"Backlog\",\n      \"category\": \"To Do\",\n      \"color\": \"blue-gray\"\n    },\n    \"issue_type\": {\n      \"name\": \"Epic\"\n    },\n    \"priority\": {\n      \"name\": \"Lowest\"\n    },\n    \"assignee\": {\n      \"display_name\": \"Unassigned\"\n    },\n    \"reporter\": {\n      \"display_name\": \"Luke O'Malley\",\n      \"name\": \"Luke O'Malley\",\n      \"email\": \"luke@procurementsciences.com\",\n      \"avatar_url\": \"https://avatar-management--avatars.us-west-2.prod.public.atl-paas.net/712020:4110baba-7778-4e0d-8549-12f13af9b21f/bb56271a-dce9-43fa-ab52-062e5c85a859/48\"\n    },\n    \"created\": \"2025-08-22T09:40:34.838-0600\",\n    \"updated\": \"2025-08-22T09:40:34.958-0600\"\n  }\n}"}]}

Why\n\nThe current integration captures minimal data (6 fields for Accounts, 5 for Contacts, 7 for Opportunities) which limits customer value. Implementing comprehensive data collection will:\n- Provide customers with complete Salesforce data instead of limited subsets\n- Include custom fields that contain business-specific information\n- Ensure opportunity data is properly captured (currently configured but not properly exported)\n- Maximize ROI of the Salesforce integration for customers\n\nh3. User Stories\n\n- As a customer, I want all available account data captured, so that I have complete visibility into my Salesforce accounts\n- As a customer, I want all contact information including custom fields, so that I don't lose important relationship data\n- As a customer, I want comprehensive opportunity data, so that I can analyze my complete sales pipeline\n- As a system administrator, I want the integration to gracefully handle permission restrictions, so that users still receive available data even when some fields are restricted\n\nh3.

Use {{DescribeSObjectResult.fields}} to identify all queryable and accessible fields\n3. Filter fields based on permissions and queryability flags\n4. Implement fallback to current limited field set if discovery fails\n\n*Phase 2 - Enhanced Query Construction*:\n1. Update {{constructQuery}} method to use dynamically discovered fields\n2. Implement query size optimization to stay within SOQL limits\n3. Add proper handling for different field types (text, number, date, relationship)\n4. Ensure relationship queries for sub-objects use comprehensive field sets\n\n*Phase 3 - Custom Field Support*:\n1. Identify and include custom fields (fields ending with {{__c}})\n2. Handle different custom field types appropriately\n3. Implement data type conversion for PDF export\n4. Add error handling for inaccessible custom fields\n\n*Phase 4 - Opportunity Integration*:\n1.

Why\\n\\nThe current integration captures minimal data (6 fields for Accounts, 5 for Contacts, 7 for Opportunities) which limits customer value. Implementing comprehensive data collection will:\\n- Provide customers with complete Salesforce data instead of limited subsets\\n- Include custom fields that contain business-specific information\\n- Ensure opportunity data is properly captured (currently configured but not properly exported)\\n- Maximize ROI of the Salesforce integration for customers\\n\\nh3. User Stories\\n\\n- As a customer, I want all available account data captured, so that I have complete visibility into my Salesforce accounts\\n- As a customer, I want all contact information including custom fields, so that I don't lose important relationship data\\n- As a customer, I want comprehensive opportunity data, so that I can analyze my complete sales pipeline\\n- As a system administrator, I want the integration to gracefully handle permission restrictions, so that users still receive available data even when some fields are restricted\\n\\nh3. Core Functionality\\n\\nMust maintain and enhance existing functionality:\\n- Existing authentication and connection management\\n- Error handling and retry logic for failed field access\\n- Performance optimization for larger datasets\\n- Division support and storage organization\\n- Backward compatibility with existing integrations\\n\\nh3. Implementation Details\\n\\n*Phase 1 - Dynamic Field Discovery*:\\n1. Replace static {{SALESFORCE_OBJECT_SELECTED_FIELDS}} with dynamic field discovery\\n2. Use {{DescribeSObjectResult.fields}} to identify all queryable and accessible fields\\n3. Filter fields based on permissions and queryability flags\\n4. Implement fallback to current limited field set if discovery fails\\n\\n*Phase 2 - Enhanced Query Construction*:\\n1. Update {{constructQuery}} method to use dynamically discovered fields\\n2. Implement query size optimization to stay within SOQL limits\\n3. Add proper handling for different field types (text, number, date, relationship)\\n4. Ensure relationship queries for sub-objects use comprehensive field sets\\n\\n*Phase 3 - Custom Field Support*:\\n1. Identify and include custom fields (fields ending with {{__c}})\\n2. Handle different custom field types appropriately\\n3. Implement data type conversion for PDF export\\n4. Add error handling for inaccessible custom fields\\n\\n*Phase 4 - Opportunity Integration*:\\n1. Ensure Opportunity objects are properly included in account relationships\\n2. Verify opportunity data appears in account-based PDF exports\\n3. Test opportunity data completeness and accuracy\\n\\nh3. UI/UX Considerations\\n\\n- PDF layout must accommodate variable field counts gracefully\\n- Long field values should be handled appropriately (wrapping, truncation)\\n- Custom field labels should be readable and professional\\n- Consider grouping fields by type or importance for better readability\\n- Error messages should clearly indicate when fields are restricted due to permissions\\n\\nh3. Resources\\n\\n* Current implementation: {{integration-sync-worker/src/services/salesforce.service.ts:392-471}}\\n* Field constants: {{integration-sync-worker/src/utils/constants.ts:1-21}}\\n* [Salesforce Field Types Reference|https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.object_reference.meta/object_reference/primitive_data_types.htm]\\n* Research findings from DEV-5960\\n\\nh3.
