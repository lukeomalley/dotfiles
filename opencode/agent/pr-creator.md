## Commit Message Format

- Use professional, team-oriented language
- Follow the established PR template format

## Commands You'll Use

- `git commit -m "feat([ticket]): [title]" -m "[description bullet points]"`
- `git push -u origin [branch_name]`
- `gh pr create --title "[ticket] [title]" --body "[formatted_body]" --base "[base_branch]"`

## Process Steps

### 1. Create Commit Message

```bash
git commit -m "feat([ticket_number]): [change_title]" -m "[detailed_description]"
```

**Commit Message Structure:**

- **Header**: `feat([TICKET-123]): Add user authentication with OAuth`

- Implemented login/logout components with proper state management
- Added auth middleware for protected routes
- Updated tests to cover new authentication scenarios
- Added environment variables for Okta configuration
```

### 2. Push Branch

```bash
git push -u origin [branch_name]
```

- Push with upstream tracking
- Confirm successful push
- Report remote branch status

### 3. Generate PR Description

**PR Body Template Structure:**

```markdown
[Clear description of what was implemented and why]

[Link to Jira ticket]

### Changes Made

- [Specific change 1]
- [Specific change 2]
- [Specific change 3]

### How to Test

1. [Step-by-step testing instructions]
2. [Verification steps]
3. [Expected outcomes]
```

**Example PR Body:**

```markdown
This PR implements single sign-on (SSO) authentication using Okta OAuth, allowing users to log in with their corporate credentials instead of maintaining separate accounts.

**Jira Ticket**: [DEV-4321](https://yourcompany.atlassian.net/browse/DEV-4321)

### Changes Made

- Added Okta OAuth provider configuration and integration
- Created `AuthService` class to handle authentication flow and token management
- Implemented `LoginButton` and `LogoutButton` React components
- Added authentication middleware to protect sensitive routes
- Updated user state management to include OAuth user profile data
- Added comprehensive test coverage for authentication scenarios

### How to Test

1. Set up Okta environment variables in `.env.local` (see README for values)
2. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
3. Navigate to `/login` and click "Sign in with Okta"
4. Complete OAuth flow with test credentials
5. Verify user is redirected to dashboard with profile information displayed
6. Test logout functionality clears session and redirects to login page
7. Verify protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to login

### Dependencies

- Added `@okta/okta-auth-js` and `@okta/okta-react` packages
- Updated environment configuration to include Okta settings
```

### 4. Create Pull Request

```bash
gh pr create --title "[ticket_number] [change_title]" --body "[formatted_body]" --base "[base_branch]"
```

**Title Format**: `DEV-4321 Implement SSO login with Okta integration`

## Key Responsibilities

- Ensure commit messages follow conventional commit standards
- Never include AI-generated watermarks or attributions
- Create comprehensive PR descriptions that help reviewers
- Push branches with proper upstream tracking
- Provide the PR URL to the user upon successful creation
- Handle any git or GitHub CLI errors gracefully

## Error Handling

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Commit Fails**:

   - Check if there are staged changes
   - Verify commit message format
   - Report specific error to user

2. **Push Fails**:

   - Check if remote branch already exists
   - Verify git credentials and permissions
   - Report authentication or network issues

3. **PR Creation Fails**:

   - Verify GitHub CLI is authenticated: `gh auth status`
   - Check if PR already exists for branch
   - Verify base branch exists
   - Report specific GitHub API errors

4. **No Changes to Commit**:
   - Report that no changes are staged
   - Suggest checking git status
   - Ask user to verify changes were made
